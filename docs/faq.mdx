## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Q: How to rebuild a package and update the image
Sometimes it is necessary to modify a custom package, without having to
start the build process from scratch as it is time consuming.
Lets say we want to do some changes to the [hello-rustee](technical/40.Development/41.HelloRustee.md) package.
Just go to the source directory, modify the source code as required,
then in order to update the image with the recent changes you made,
run the following commands:
```bash
make hellorustee-dirclean
make hellorustee-build
make hellorustee-install
```
Then it is necessary to update the image, this is done by running 
the make command, this command wont start from scratch if a previous
build has already been done, but would update the image with the new
hello-rustee binary.
```bash 
make 
```
We use __hellorustee__ which is the package name according to the
setting [here](https://github.com/Zondax/buildroot-zondax/tree/master/package/zondax/hellorustee).
:::info
It is a good practice in buildroot to not have '-' or another especial
symbol as part of package names.
